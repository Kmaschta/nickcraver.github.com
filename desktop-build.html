          <h1>Stack Overflow Developer Desktop Build - 2017</h1>
          <p>
            One of the things we're big on at Stack Exchange is hardware - we love it. More importantly, we love <i>not waiting on it</i>. 
            With that in mind, we upgrade our developer machines every 2 years. In case it helps anyone else, I'm posting our current parts list here.
            This isn't set in stone, we review and update it to the latest tech every time we build a machine. We also customize the build for each developer if needed - for example those needing extra space or specific display connections, etc. I'll try and keep this page updated as we make changes.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you're wondering about laptops: yes, we use those too. You can buy what you want to work with. 
            Most prefer a beefy desktop and a laptop to remote in, or switch their desktop and laptop refreshes every 2 years (alternating what they spend most on). 
            We're currently using <a href="http://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-laptops/xps-15-touch/spd/xps-15-9560-laptop/dncwxb1603v2">Dell XPS 15 (9560)</a> laptops fully loaded (i7-7700HQ processor, 32GB RAM, 1TB PCIe NVMe SSD, 15.6" 4K touch display, GTX 1050 4GB). 
            Why won't we use the close cousin, the Dell Precision 5520? 
            The 5520 has a nice Xeon, but has a Quadro for graphics. 
            We want the GTX 1050 which more closely approximates the GTX 1080s we're using for CUDA programming to run our tag engine in production (and in the build below, for the same reason).
            Note: the Killer WiFi that Dell ships is unreliable. 
            I highly recommend grabbing <a href="http://amzn.to/2im6cBP">an Intel 8265 for under $25</a> (or 9260 as soon as they're out in late 2017) to replace it with. 
            You'll need a phillips and a T5 Torx driver to remove the bottom and replace it. Anyone can do it.
            If you don't have a electronics toolkit for small things, I <a href="http://amzn.to/2lGNKZc">recommend grabbing a decent one</a> you can use for pretty much every electronic device.
            We no longer use MacBook Pros due to the Touch Bar debacle (several of our developers and sysadmins gave the Touch Bar a try...and sent it back).
          </p>
          <p>
            Monitors are not on here because they're usually a separate purchase rarely made at the same time. 
            Most of our developers use 3x 30" <a href="https://amzn.to/2frWkCZ">Dell UP3017s</a> (whatever the current 30" model is), but this also varies widely. 
            Some prefer the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/LG-Electronics-34UM95-34-Inch-LED-Lit/dp/B00JR6GCZA">LG 34" 21:9 UM95 widescreens</a> for example. 
            Lately, 4K and 5K are becoming more common. 
            We're hoping some single-cable 5K monitors (DisplayPort 1.3+) start arriving, then they'll be practical too - right now they're a connectivity issue. 
            Keyboards &amp; mice are much more varied - the <a href="https://amzn.to/2fuYIfD">CODE keyboard</a> quite a few devs use (yeah, we all have various switches) but everything is very much personal choice for looks, ergonomics, etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            Make special note of the memory here. 
            DDR4 is still changing, and it's shifting with every build we do. 
            For the big memory users (VMs, SQL, redis clusters, machine learning, etc.), we are going with a 128GB setup. 
            For lighter workloads, we may only get 64GB since it's so easy to add another 64GB later. 
            Why do we get 128GB? Because if you need more than 64GB it's relatively cheap compared to anything else to increase productivity. 
            It's a very easy barrier to buy your way out of.
            Note: memory is more expensive across the board right now due to recent phone releases constraining NAND supply and a world-wide shortage starting before that.

                    There are several X299 options out there, but fewer with high-end WiFi onboard (which several of our devs need).

                    If you need far less memory, a good option is this <a href="http://amzn.to/2xLFjgO">32GB kit</a> (currently $374.99). For high-end workloads, we get two of these kits for 128GB total.
